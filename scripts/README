Included in this diretory are some scripts for gathering summary 
statistics from results obtained from gpsr runs. 

The files gather_stats.m and create_cps.m require GNU octave.
Their associated .sh files are wrappers for running the statistics
operations from the command line.

For example, if you have performed 30 runs of gpsr and each results
file has the form resX (where X is 01..30) then you can use the provided
scripts as follows:

prompt$ cat res?? > all_results.dat

prompt$ ./dostats.sh 30 101

In the above example, 30 refers to the number of runs carried out and 101
to the total number of generations (e.g. 0 .. 100). The output of the above
is the mean training and testing performance of the runs (with errors included
to provide errorbar plots)

The script "docps.sh" can be used to calculate the cumulative probability of
success (used similarly to above, it assumes that the "hits percentage" from
training is in the 4th column of a file called all_results.dat).
